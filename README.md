# Student Cookbook

This is my (if you'll contribute, this will be "our") attempt at documenting cooking recipes that are useful for somewhat successful student life.
Or any other kind of life where you want to control what you are eating - be it for fitness/weight reasons, because you're tight on budget, or any other reason really.

There will also be some Estonia-specific recommendations on food prices, brands, etc. based on the author's presonal experiences.
