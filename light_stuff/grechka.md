## Buckwheat a.k.a. grechka a.k.a. tatar

### Ingredients:
* Buckwheat
* Water
* Salt & pepper to taste
* Butter to taste
* Feta or any other kind of Cheese, or Yoghurt

For 1 parts Buckwheat use 1.5 parts Water, or eyeball it.

Rinse the buckwheat, this will help with removing bad kernels and other questionable stuff.
Some people don't wash rice and that's fine but buckwheat sometimes has stems and such, better to rinse.

Butter can be any butter, sometimes using herb butter is very nice too.

### Cooking
If you have time, leaving it on med-low (or 4-5/10 on ceramic/induction) until the water
has been absorbed and evaported should be enough, usually 10-15 minutes.
If you don't have time and want to shave 3-5 minutes, it's better to boil the water and buckwheat in the pot,
then tone the heat down, but this works best if you have induction/gas stove. In most Tallinn dorms you should have
more than one burner, so boiling on one and switching to other is the most valid strategy.

After that, put the butter in the buckwheat, add salt & pepper, anything else you want in there and that's all, bone apple teeth!

### Estonia specific:
Buckwheat was very cheap back before the Ukraine war, but now the prices are going down slowly.
It was ~1 EUR/kg before, now it's ~2-3 EUR/kg depending on where you buy and which producer's.
Tartu Mill has in my experience the most stable product/price performance throughout the years,
Veski Mati coming in close second but it's much more expensive for no apparent reason.
Store's own production usually has too much gunk in it, even Selver has quite a lot of bad kernels, so
I'd recommend against it.
