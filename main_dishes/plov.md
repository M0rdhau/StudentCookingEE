## Plov

One of the best dishes to cook as a student is usually something like this - dry, can be heated up
easily, transportable (if you have a container) and easy to eat (I'm looking at you, chicken wing soup).

### Ingredients:
* 500g of meat - usually pork because it's cheap and available. Lamb is good, beef is expensive.
* 200g of rice.
* two or three medium carrots, depending on taste.
* One medium or large onion.
* Three to five cloves of garlic, also depending on taste.
* Spices: Curry (something yellow), ground cumin, kurkum, paprika,
some sort of spicy ground pepper (none of these are necessary, but enhance the taste).
* Salt, Pepper.

Rinse the rice, make sure not to touch anything with meat-y hands.

### Cooking
Cut the meat into bite-sized chunks, chop onions into small cubes, and carrots as you prefer:
smaller size will make the dish overall sweeter, but larger carrots are a bit too sweet after cooking
so I generally go smaller.

Sizzle the meat in the pot, after it's lost its pink, add onions and sweat them.
Afterwards, add carrots and whole garlic cloves - you can add some water here, I don't.
Let the carrots cook - after a bit (you can check if they're starting to soften) add rice, and 
cover the entire thing with water, just enough to submerge most of the dish, and don't worry
about overdoing it - original plov has quite a lot of water.
Right after adding water, you can add all your seasonings and wait until the whole thing is cooked.

Once the water has subsided and rice has increased in size, check if rice kernels are cooked - if yes,
it's done. If rice is undercooked and there is no water (check with spatula) water can be added.

### Estonia specific:
I personally try to buy Rakvere pork/beef if I only have a small store, but in places such as Mustamae
turg you can find different meats, sometimes cheaper than store prices, and almost always matching if
not better quality.

Vegetables have the same story as meat when it comes to Turgs, but if you go to any store, the huge
piles of veggies usually have lower quality on average, but good quality items can be found.
You can save some money if you don't have to worry about time.
